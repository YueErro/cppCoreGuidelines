# SF: Source files

Distinguish between declarations (used as interfaces) and definitions (used as implementations). Use header files to represent interfaces and to emphasize logical structure.

### SF.4: Include `.h` files before other declarations in a file

_SF.1: Use a `.cpp` suffix for code files and `.h` for interface files if your project doesnâ€™t already follow another convention_

```cpp
// foo.cpp
#include <foo.h>

#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>
// ... my code here ...
```

_SF.5: A `.cpp` file must include the `.h` file(s) that defines its interface_
